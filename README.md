TO-DO

## Use Cases

- A minimal docs page, to just get the point across

- A blog page, where the main focus is just your writing.

- Anything else that you would need for just a simple webpage, without any of the stupid bullsh*t that a "modern" website has.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LapisGit/Lapkyll.git
    cd Lapkyll
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. Run the site locally:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

4. If it goes according to plan, without any errors, the theme should now running locally on `https://localhost:4000` If any errors occur, please try to troubleshoot it, and even if it doesn't work then, make a GitHub Issue.

### Development

To set up for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LapisGit/Lapkyll.git
cd Lapkyll
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

The `--livereload` flag will automatically refresh your browser when you make changes.

You could also use `--watch` but you have to manually refresh.
