# Lapkyll

Hello, and welcome to the main example page for **Lapkyll!**

Lapkyll is a nice *light* purple Jekyll theme, made for an event called [Tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com) which is an YSWS (You Ship, We Ship) event ran by [Hack Club!](https://hackclub.com) if you're in high school, I'd totally recommend checking Hack Club out, as they hvae loads of events just like Tonic running everywhere, anytime!

Here's some use cases for this theme:

- A minimal docs page, to just get the point across [Example!](https://notimplementedyet.com)

- A blog page, where the main focus is just your writing. [Example!](https://notimplementedyet.com)

- Anything else that you would need for just a simple webpage, without any of the stupid bullsh*t that a "modern" website has.

If this theme interests you, you can see how to use and install it on the ``README.md`` file inside of the [GitHub Repository!](https://github.com/LapisGit/Lapkyll)
